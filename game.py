# todo: write some Python code here to satisfy the exercise objectives
# ... https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/main/exercises/rock-paper-scissors/README.md
#
#Make a plan before we write any python code: remind us of our objectives and then figure out the action plan

# ASK FOR USER INPUT
# docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input
# Use an input function to get user input
# input() wants the textual prompt that will be shown to the user --> use quotes to pass a string data type 
# example input("What is your favourite colour")
# this will give a textbox for user to input their answer
# to use the value that the user inputs, you must assign a variable to the user's input 
# example x = input("What is your favourite colour")
# print(x)
# print(type(x))

U = input("Please choose one of : 'rock' , 'paper' or 'scissors' : ")
print("USER CHOSE:", U)
